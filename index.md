I am a community ecologist passionate about nature conservation, sustainability, and environmental justice. I am interested in studying population dynamics, species interactions and the impact of anthropogenic activities on ecological processes and functioning.

I'm a PhD student in Zoology with [Owen Lewis](https://communityecology.zoo.ox.ac.uk/) at [Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/). Here, I study the thermal response of different biological levels (i.e. organisms, populations and communities) and apply this knowledge to understand species distribution and predict their response to climate change. The research uses a highly versatile experimental system ------ rainforest <i>Drosophila</i> and its natural enemy, parasitoid wasps. This bi-trophic system with multiple hosts and multiple parasitoid species enables me to step into the complexity of the direct and indirect biological effects of climate change. In the future, I am particularly interested in studying similar topics in areas such as epidemiology, biological invasion, and agriculture management.

Previously in my undergraduate study, I explored multiple research topics such as neurobiology, population genetics and biodiversity conservation. My undergraduate thesis was on individual-based simulation to infer the dispersal patterns of the white-headed langur.
